### SETUP ENVIRONMENT
[000_SETUP_ENVIRONMENT](https://github.com/janieblas/STM32F446E_whitout_stm32CubeIDE/tree/main/000_SETUP_ENVIRONMENT)

#### SUMMARY
With this repository, I want to demonstrate how to set up a project to program an STM32F446RE board without using STM32CubeIDE. This involves using WSL/WSL2 with Linux (Ubuntu) and VSCode on Windows. Starting with a minimal 'bare-metal' example and gradually adding standard libraries to create a more complex project. I hope this can help you in some way.

#### TOOLS 
- ARM Toolchain (default 13.3)
- WSL/WSL2
- Ubuntu (18.04 to 24.04)
- VsCode

#### I used the STM32F446RE board.
This repository can be adapted to any board in the STM32F4 family.
