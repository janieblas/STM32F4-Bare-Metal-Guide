#### SUMMARY
With this repository, I want to demonstrate how to set up a project to program an STM32F446RE board without using STM32CubeIDE. This involves using a Linux (Ubuntu) virtual machine and VSCode on Windows with SSH. Starting with a minimal 'bare-metal' example and gradually adding standard libraries to create a more complex project. I hope this can help you in some way.

#### Tools 
Toolchain version: arm-gnu-toolchain-13.2.Rel1-x86_64-arm-none-eabi

This repository can be adapted to any board in the STM32F4 family.
